        I myself may having a difficult time to separate from the digital world
        and the material world. The relationship between me and the digital world
        and the material world is wholly unique, one that dumbs down to one
        oppressing the other, a terrible mindset. The occasional pangs of earthly
        needs such as making a cup of MILO with Stef, going to the loo and staying
        hydrated reminds me that there is a world where my physical being is
        constantly changing, maintaining homeostasis, metabolism.
      </p>

            <p>
        Unseen acts of publication? Back to the topic. Moving towards a mindset
        that is separated from causality because increasingly it becomes harder
        to see the sense in them. Focusing on the relationships between these
        ediums, platforms that each inform each other, their meanings and
        intentions are imbued and obscured by the way they are transited to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within the digital world, these are the sites that I lost my sense of time:
        <ul>
          <li> Youtube </li>
          <li> Facebook </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Or maybe I could lump it all up together and categorise the purpose?
        Or what did I get from them, the relationships, the similar relationships.
        Structurally similar based on the same relationships between the elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        A way of splitting up the relationships between the different forms of
        media that I consume (that’s one relationship already). Representing
        forms of relationships akin to how I relate to them, as a user.
        As what I am experiencing shouldn’t be different from others now
        should it? A process, that’s right! The web of actions and interactions
        grounds a journey. From these relationships that I could systemise,
        start seeing the relationships between these elements as bidirectional,
         more than a consuming, a one way, more than preferring one to it,
        I am attracted to the complexity of these relationships,
        so much it can hold, infer, the beauty in the mysteriousness
        at its current state. But don’t get me wrong, obscurity in
        rigidity is the spark, unravelling it is the fun part,
        I don’t know why I feel I need to slowly chip away at this
        task to uncover the form of the fossil within in, knowing
        it will a can of open worms, more and more complexity.
      </p>

      <p>
        The way of life, is to take in and embrace the uncertainties,
         complexities that lie in the volatile relationships,
         between you and me, the videos I watch and I, the food and I,
        the stars and I, and me <em>myself</em> and I.
