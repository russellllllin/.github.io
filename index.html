<h3> Erased –– 2020 </h3>

<p> – To create a warning video by experimenting with pixilation and keying.<p>
<p>*Insert generic comment on proliferation of screens in everyday lives* This
film uses pixilation to depict the jail-like environment constructed by the
over-reliance on digital services.<p>
<p> <small> One minute film. </small> <p>

<h3> What About the Moon and Me? –– 2020 </h3>

<p> –To explore the language of film by producing a film from 35mm celluloid film.<p>

<p>From the get-go, cinema is utilised for its ability to “observe”, rather
than its ability to stitch together fragmented time. This film challenges the
pre-existing schema that movies are narrative in nature, by splicing found footage
together to form pure perceptive experience.<p>

<h3>Soundscape –– 2019 </h3>
<p> – To question the authenticity if a place through interactive
audio experiments. <p>

<p>This piece is a response to the separating nature of boundaries. Inspired by Schafer ’s ideas on soundscape and Debord’s Society of the Spectacle, this interactive audio experiment questions our sense of place by injecting a foreign soundscape into the current space.

Using the Kinect’s proximity and IR sensor, passersby within a prescribed distance will trigger pre-recorded sounds. In this example. the prerecorded sounds were components of the soundscape from Regent’s Park, and they were played into a studio environment in Central Saint Martins (the Graphics studios). <p>

<h3>Uncertainty Mapping –– 2019 </h3>
<p> – To explore alternative cartographic methods. <p>

<p>Inspired by the latent possibilities within maps (as a result of choosing what to include on a map), and historical notion of  physically traversing oceans to uncover new territories, this interactive piece relies on the movements of its participants to uncover their environment.
Using a webcam, the screen either gets less pixelated or brighter as it senses motion. In the absence of instructions, random movements provide a clear video feed, rewarding the participants’ uncertain behaviour.

<h3>Human Clock –– 2019 </h3>

<p> – To reconsider and readpt timekeeping in a more relevant way. <p>
<p>Historically timekeeping has been pegged to a natural constant, and as technology becomes more sophisticated, so too is the demand for precision and reliability in timekeeping. Given our increasingly image-mediated reality, perhaps snapshots of time can be chronicled into images, with the duration up to its users. <p>
<p>  This project seeks to do away the rigid (yet standardised) notion of time, by letting the user set the duration between each photo. The result is a matrix of photos that can have different durations between them, different users and different places. <p>

<h3> Transparency –– 2018 </h3>
<p>  – To translate the essence of a place visually. <p>
<p>This project is about documenting the process of familiarising and situating oneself in a foreign place. Inspired by John Cage’s 4’33”, the essence of a location is captured by the marks left by the suspended pen.
